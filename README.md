Project: Power BI Integration for Customer Service Excellence

Dashboard Leadership: Spearheaded the development of the TECNow Customer Delight dashboard, used by multiple stakeholders to monitor open tickets, critical issues, and customer satisfaction. The dashboard provided key metrics, including the number of open tickets, tickets opened and closed each month, and critical issues, offering a comprehensive view of performance.
Real-Time Updates: Enabled real-time data analytics through Power BI, ensuring decision-makers had access to the most up-to-date information. This resulted in a 20% reduction in response times for customer issues.
Automation: Implemented two Power Automate flows to automate the data collection and update processes for the dashboard, significantly reducing manual intervention and increasing operational efficiency. These automated flows ensured the dashboard was always refreshed with real-time data, improving overall response times and accuracy.
